    User List
    =========

    The user list is where most discussions occur. The focus of 
    the user list is indeed issues & suggestions related to the 
    use of TorqueBox. If you think you've found a bug, the user 
    list is an excellent place to start. The community can help 
    determine if you're having a simple usage issue, or have 
    found a true defect.
    
    The developers of the TorqueBox project participate on the user list regularly.

    Developer List
    ==============

    The developer list is where the developers discuss internal designs, 
    choices and complexity. If you are interested in the inner workings 
    and how they are built, the developer list is an excellent resource.
    
    Since the developers also participate on the user list, there is no 
    need to initiate bug reports on the developer list. The developers will 
    escalate true defects to the developer list to determine the proper course of action.
