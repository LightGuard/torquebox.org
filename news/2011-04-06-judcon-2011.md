If you've ever wanted to meet the people behind TorqueBox, the entire
[Project:odd][] team will be attending [JUDCon 2011][] in Boston on
May 2nd and 3rd. I'll be giving a talk on "Scaling Rails Applications
With TorqueBox" and later in the week Bob will present "TorqueBox: The
Beauty of Ruby with the Power of JBoss" at [Red Hat Summit /
JBossWorld][jbw], also in Boston.

If you're attending either event or will be in the area get in touch
with us via Twitter, IRC, or email and we'll buy you a beer or three
while you tell us all the awesome features you want in the next
version of TorqueBox. This will be the first time our entire team has
ever been in one place so it's guaranteed to be a blast!
