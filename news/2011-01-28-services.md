title: Long-running Services in TorqueBox

We've already seen how to execute [asynchronous background
tasks][tasks] in TorqueBox, but what if our application needs a
persistent background daemon that's neither a scheduled job nor a
background task? Luckily, TorqueBox has a solution for this as well.

TorqueBox Services are a really cool way to replace the external
daemons that Ruby applications seem to accumulate over time with
something that's integrated with the rest of the
application. [Download] the latest developer build, give them a try,
and I think you'll agree that TorqueBox Services are far easier than
managing an external process.

To learn about TorqueBox Services, we'll create an IRC bot that runs
as a Service. Portions of the sample application will be displayed
inline and the entire source is available at
<https://github.com/torquebox/torquebox-irc-bot>.

# Add a Service to Our Application

Adding a Service only requires creating a services.yml and a class
with initialize, start, and stop methods. We're going to start with a
basic Rails 3 application but TorqueBox Services also work with Rails
2 and Rack applications.

First let's add a config/services.yml containing the class of our
Service, IrcBotService, and the initialization parameters it needs.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/800711.js"></script>

<noscript>
    IrcBotService:
      nick: torquebox_bot
      server: irc.freenode.net
      port: 6667
      channel: '#torquebox'
</noscript>

Then let's add the referenced IrcBotService class under a new
app/services/ folder.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/800982.js"></script>

<noscript>
    class IrcBotService
      def initialize(options={})
        @nick = options['nick']
        @server = options['server']
        @port = options['port']
        @channel = options['channel']
      end

      def start
        @bot = configure_bot
        # Start the IRC bot in a separate thread
        @bot_thread = Thread.new { @bot.connect }
      end

      def stop
        # Disconnect from IRC
        @bot.quit
        # Wait for the bot thread to exit
        @bot_thread.join
      end
    end
</noscript>

The start method of IrcBotService gets called when our application is
deployed. An EventMachine event loop gets started inside
`@bot.connect` so we execute that in a separate thread since the start
method should execute quickly and not block.

When our application is undeployed the stop method gets called so we
can cleanly disconnect from IRC.

That's all the code that's required to get rid of those Ruby daemons
and manage them alongside your web application in TorqueBox. Stay
tuned for a future article where we'll connect a web application to
the IrcBotService for near-real-time display of messages.
