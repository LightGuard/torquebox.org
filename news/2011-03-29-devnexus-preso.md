Here is [Bob] talking at Atlanta's [DevNexus] 2011 about TorqueBox.
This talk is geared more to Java developers and highlights the
features we've added in the short time since [MagicRuby].
Specifically: [caching], [injection], [BackStage], [StompBox], and
[BENchmarks]!

Special mention should be made of [Ben] Browning, who did yet another
fantastic job of video recording and editing.  Yay, Ben!

One personal note: DevNexus was fun!  It's a very well-run conference,
due in no small part to our own [Burr] Sutter.  It was also awesome
hanging out with other fellow JBoss/Red Hatters, [Brian] Ashburn and
Andrew [ALR] Rubinger, whose own DevNexus presentation will be posted
soon.

One professional note: we've changed the injection syntax slightly.
We've replaced all the `cdi/topic/queue/mc/jndi` method calls
referenced in the slides with a single, general-purpose `inject`
method.
