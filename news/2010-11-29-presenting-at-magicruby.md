I'm happy to announce that our TorqueBox talk proposal was accepted
by the [MagicRuby](http://magic-ruby.com) organizers last week!  My
daughters are particularly excited about this, as I can't very well go
to Disney World without them now, can I?!

Toby Crawley, who helped me with the proposal, and Ben Browning are
among the other [Project Odd](http://projectodd.org) team members
who'll be attending.  It should be fun!

Although TorqueBox has long been attractive to enterprise Java guys
looking to expand their toolset with Ruby, it's great to see that the
JRuby ecosystem has evolved to the point that TorqueBox makes for a
great development and deployment platform for the pure Ruby guys, too.
My plan is to emphasize those aspects in this presentation.

So I probably ought to get started writing it.  ;-)
