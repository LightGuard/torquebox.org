Last night I had the pleasure of presenting TorqueBox to 
the gang at  [Raleigh.rb][raleighrb] in Raleigh, NC. It 
was a fun bunch of folks, and I appreciate them 
having me over. 

I wanted to follow up on a few of the questions from the end of the talk:

* I'd like to apologize to the gentleman that asked about dependency 
  management on deployment. I cut you off before you even finished 
  the question, and went in to a three minute monologue on dependency
  injection, when that wasn't even what you were asking about! So, I'm 
  sorry.
* I realized that in my dependency injection monologue, I never actually
  stated what dependency injection is, or why it can be useful. If you
  want to know, check out [this article][DI].
* Nathaniel asked "where does the money change hands?", and I mentioned
  that Red Hat would probably productize TorqueBox someday. However, 
  I neglected to mention that TorqueBox the [project][project] will always be 
  available freely under the [LGPL][LGPL].
  
Here are links to a few resources I mentioned in the talk:

* [TorqueBox Caching](/news/2011/03/09/torquebox-caching/)
* [Clustering](/news/tags/clustering/) - 
  I mentioned one article, we actually have several on
  the topic, including the caching article above.
* The [full BENchmarks](/news/tags/benchmarks/), 
  though I neglected to actually mention these articles in the talk.
  
If you missed the talk (or even if you didn't), you can
still peruse the slides:
