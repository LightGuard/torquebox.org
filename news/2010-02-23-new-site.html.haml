  We've just relaunched the [TorqueBox](http://torquebox.org/) website
  in preparation for our upcoming 1.0.0.Beta19 release.

  The site is now generated by [AweStruct](http://github.com/bobmcwhirter/awestruct), 
  a Jekyll-inspired site-baking toolkit.  The entire website is generated from
  sources kept in a Git repository, easily forked and contributed to by anyone
  from the community.  Additionally, we've enabled comments on news items and 
  release announcements.

  We've slightly re-organized, such as the addition of the [Resources](/resources),
  and [FAQ](/faq/) pages.  Let us know if you have any suggestions for changes or improvements.
