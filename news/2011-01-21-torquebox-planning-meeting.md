Since TorqueBox 1.0 has entered the release-candidate phase, we thought
it would be good to begin some broad-stroke planning for life after 1.0.

Next Monday, [24 January 2011][meeting-time], the TorqueBox team will be having a planning
meeting on IRC at [10am US-Eastern (1500 UTC)][meeting-time].

Please stop by [#torquebox on freenode][torquebox-channel] to participate
or simply observe.

During this meeting, we'd like to expand what "TorqueBox" means
to include *any* place that Ruby might touch JBoss projects.  Even
outside of the TorqueBox AS environment.

Some rough ideas include, but are certainly not limited to...

* Infinispan client, ActiveSupport::Cache, ActiveRecord bindings
* Drools, jBPM integration
* ModeShape, Teiid

Please, [drop by][torquebox-channel] and help define the future of JVM-based Ruby.
