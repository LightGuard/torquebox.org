After spending countless hours discussing TorqueBox with
a variety of people, many of them European, I've come to
the conclusion that the project is poorly named.

Specifically, the French tend to pronounce "Torque" with
two syllables, which vaguely resembles the word "Turkey".

Sometimes you have to pick your battles, and this is one
I'm willing to cede.  Henceforth, this enterprise-grade
Ruby application server previously known as TorqueBox
is now simply *TurkeyBox*.

Thanks to James Cobb, designer extraordinaire, we have a
new logo.
