This past Tuesday, I had the pleasure of presenting TorqueBox to 
the guys at the [Upstate Carolina Linux Users Group][UCLUG] in 
Greenville, SC. It was a fun bunch of folks, and I appreciate them 
inviting me down.

Those of you that missed the talk can still enjoy the slides, 
though they lack that special thrill of seeing me present in 
person:
