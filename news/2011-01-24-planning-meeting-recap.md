As [previously announced][annc], we held a planning meeting on IRC to organize
our activity beyond the forthcoming 1.0 release.

During the hour, the community created or updated over a dozen
[issues in JIRA][meeting-issues] to track the progress.

These include:

* WebSockets
* Infinispan for local caching
* Infinispan for distributed persistence
* Exposure of components via JMX
* CDI injection into Ruby components
* `git push` style deployment

and others exciting features.

The [full meeting log is available][irclog].

If you missed this meeting, don't fret!  Just surf over to [JIRA][jira]
and file some feature requests.
