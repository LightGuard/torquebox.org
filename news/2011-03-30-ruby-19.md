With the release of [JRuby 1.6.0][jruby], we're now able to expose support
for running applications under JRuby's ruby 1.9.2 compatibility mode
(it is ruby 1.8.7 compatible by default).

## Enabling 1.9

If you are running our latest [CI build][ci-build], enabling 1.9 support is 
easy peasy - just add a `ruby:` section to your `torquebox.yml`:

    ruby:
      version: 1.9

The options for `version` are:

* `1.8` - The app will run in 1.8.7 compatibility mode (the default)
* `1.9` - The app will run in 1.9.2 compatibility mode 

## Overriding JRuby's JIT mode

While we were at it, we exposed control over JRuby's [Just-In-Time][jit]
compiler, for those that want to play with that. It is also specified in
the `ruby:` section:

    ruby:      
      compile_mode: off 
      
The options for `compile_mode` are:

* `jit` - Tells JRuby to use JIT on code where it determines there will
  be a speed improvement (the default)
* `force` - Tells JRuby to use JIT on all code
* `off` - Turns off JIT completely

These options are per application, and apply to all of the runtimes 
(messaging, jobs, web, etc) for the app. This allows you to have
1.8 and 1.9 apps running inside the same TorqueBox.

## Wear safety glasses

For now, 1.9 support is beta (well, *more* beta than the rest of
TorqueBox). If you have any issues or see any odd behavior, please 
[get in touch][community]. One particular area of concern is File/Dir/IO 
methods - we monkey patch the ass out of those classes to support
file operations within archives, and there may be cases where those
patches don't fully honor changes from 1.9.
