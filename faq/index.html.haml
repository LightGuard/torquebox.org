    # What is TorqueBox?
  
    TorqueBox is a small adaptation layer on top of Java application server from JBoss, [JBoss AS](http://jboss.org/jbossas/).
  
    It attempts to go beyond providing web-centric services (supporting Rails, Rack, Sinatra, etc),
    to also expose other enterprise-grade services to Ruby applications.
  
    # If it's a small layer, why is it a 250mb download?
  
    One goal of the TorqueBox distribution is a simplified end-user experience. 
    To accomplish this, the distribution includes a pre-integrated combination
    of the TorqueBox code, the base JBoss AS application server, and the full
    JRuby distribution, plus some useful gems such as Rails, Rack and Sinatra.
  
    The result is a 250mb distribution with everything you need (except for a JDK)
    right in the tin.
  
    # Why is TorqueBox still in "beta"?
  
    TorqueBox is primarily developed by Bob McWhirter, the master of the perma-beta.
  
    Ultimately, the APIs are still shifting with each release, while we attempt
    to figure out the correct way to make the power of JBoss technologies available
    naturally to Rubyists.
  
    # Will TorqueBox ever support \[Python,Scala,Groovy,...\]
  
    Not directly, no.
  
    Of those, Python is the most interesting, and could certainly benefit
    from a similar initiative. 
  
    Scala, Groovy, and any other more Java-natural language already integrate
    pretty well with Java application servers, so what's there to do?
